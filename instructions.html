        <p class="head_instruc">STORYLINE</p>
        <p>In this game you will have to complete a race in which you will be
        given multiple choices. Depending on what you choose you will end up with
        a different ending. The game has multiple elements that will allow you to
        gain more points, gain more time and even an extra life. These are explained
        more in detail further down. As soon as you start the game, the timer will
        start. You will have 5 minutes to complete the game before time runs out and
        you die. While playing you will be able to mute/unmute sounds and pause/resume
        the game</p>
      </div>

      <div class="grid-item2">
        <p class="head_instruc">HOW DO I MOVE?</p>
        <p>With your keyboard! As simple as that. Use the arrows on your
        keyboard to move around. UP, DOWN, LEFT to RIGHT...</p>
      </div>

      <div class="grid-item3">
        <p class="head_instruc">EXTRA TIME?</p>
        <p>The game will be timed but you will be given the opportunity to
        gain more time by collecting <span class="popWords">mushrooms</span>
        while playing. These will be hidden around the screen so that you find
        them difficult to find. Some will be easier than others</p>
      </div>


      <div class="grid-item4">
        <p class="head_instruc">LIFE COUNT</p>
        <p>Once you start the game you only have 1 life. If you make a bad decision
          you will be dead without having the possibility to resume playing. However,
          you will be able to gain an extra life by collecting <span class="popWords"
          >stars</span> that will be hidden around the screen just
          like the mushrooms</p>
      </div>

      <div class="grid-item5">
        <p class="head_instruc">PROGRESS BAR</p>
        <p>At all times a progress bar will be displayed below the game title.
        This will show you how far you have come and how much you have left to finish
        the race/game. Whenever you press a button, depending on what type of choice
        you make, the progress bar will or will not progress</p>
